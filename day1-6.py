#! What are containers ?
#? a,b,c are the containers that holds the value of integer and string

a="21th";      #! this is string
b="July";
c=2023;       #! this is integer
print(a,b,c);

#! What are data types?
#? Data types in Python are used to define the kind of data that a variable can store. 
#? There are 5 main data types in Python:

# * Numeric:- data types store numbers. 
# * There are two types of numeric data types: integers and floating-point numbers. 
# * Integers store whole numbers, while floating-point numbers store numbers with decimals.

f=complex(1,9);
print("The type of",d,"is:", type(d));
print("The type of",e,"is:", type(e));
print("The type of",f,"is:", type(f));


# * String:- data types store text. 
# * Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.
print("\n");

a="Aviral";
b="Sharma";
print(a,b);
print("The type of",a,"is:",type(a));
print("The type of",b,"is:",type(b));

# * Boolean:- data types store true or false values.
print("\n");

c=True;
g=False;
print(c);
print(g);
print("The type of",c,"is",type(c));
print("The type of",g,"is",type(g));


# * List:- data types store a collection of values. Lists are enclosed in square brackets.
print("\n");

list1=[8,8.5,[-4,5],["apple","banana"]]
print(list1);

# * Tuples:- data types store a collection of values. Lists are enclosed in parenthesis.
# * Tuples are immutable that means it can not be change once declare in the code.
print("\n");

tuples1=[8,8.5,[-4,5],["apple","banana"]]
print(tuples1);

# * Dictionary:- data types store a collection of key-value pairs. 
# * Dictionaries are enclosed in curly brackets.

#! In python very container is object and there declared values, All are OBJECTS
